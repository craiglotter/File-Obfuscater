File Obfuscater
===============

File Obfuscater attempts to scramble a file's contents on a byte level by breaking up a file into segments and then reassembling the file out of order. The file can later be restored to its original state by simply running the application on the obfuscated file again.

Note: Assembly signed using CodeUnit.snk
